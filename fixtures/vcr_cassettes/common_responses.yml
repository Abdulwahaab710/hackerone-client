        do not appear to be any security implications as a direct result of this behavior.
        If you disagree, please reply with additional information describing your
        reasoning. Including a working proof-of-concept can be incredibly helpful
        in our assessment of these claims.\n"}},{"id":"108880","attributes":{"title":"Language
        Barrier","message":"Sorry, I''m having a difficult time understanding this
        report. Please reply with a proof of concept and more technical details about
        the vulnerability, the impact of this vulnerability and any suggested fixes
        for this vulnerability. Including screenshots or a short video can be worth
        a thousand words. If you don''t speak English, feel free to leave your report
        in your own language, and we''ll try our best to find someone who can help
        translate.\n"}},{"id":"108881","attributes":{"title":"Logout cross-site request
        forgery","message":"For better or worse, the design of HTTP cookies means
        that no single website can prevent its users from being logged out; consequently,
        application-specific ways of achieving this goal will likely not qualify.
        You may be interested in personal blog posts from Chris Evans (https://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.com/2010/01/logout-xsrf-significant-web-app-bug.html)
        and Michal Zalewski (https://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2010/10/http-cookies-or-how-not-to-design.html)
        for more background.\n"}},{"id":"108882","attributes":{"title":"Open Redirect","message":"We
        recognize that the address bar is the only reliable security indicator in
        modern browsers. As a result, we typically do not treat arbitrary URL redirection
        behavior (\"Open Redirects\") as a security vulnerability unless you are able
        to demonstrate risks that do not depend upon social engineering.\n"}},{"id":"108883","attributes":{"title":"Strict-Transport-Security
        Not Necessary On This Domain","message":"Automated vulnerability scanners
        commonly have low priority issues and/or false positives. Before submitting
        the results from a scanner, please take a moment to confirm that the reported
        issues are actually valid and exploitable. In this specific case, the `Strict-Transport-Security`
        header is not suitable for the domain in question because it is intentionally
        accessible over both HTTP and HTTPS. If we ever migrate to 100% HTTPS on this
        domain, we''ll consider enabling the header at that time.\n"}},{"id":"108884","attributes":{"title":"Cookie
        Missing HttpOnly","message":"Automated vulnerability scanners commonly have
        low priority issues and/or false positives. Before submitting the results
        from a scanner, please take a moment to confirm that the reported issues are
        actually valid and exploitable. In this specific case, many cookies intentionally
        lack the `HttpOnly` flag so that they can be accessed from JavaScript. This
        only introduces a potential risk if the cookie in question contains session
        data or other sensitive information.\n"}},{"id":"108885","attributes":{"title":"Cookie

        low priority issues and/or false positives. Before submitting the results

        actually valid and exploitable. In this specific case, many cookies intentionally
        lack the `secure` flag so that they can be accessed from HTTP pages. This
        only introduces a potential risk if the cookie in question contains sensitive
        information that must be served over HTTPS.\n"}},{"id":"108886","attributes":{"title":"X-XSS-Protection","message":"Automated
        vulnerability scanners commonly have low priority issues and/or false positives.
        Before submitting the results from a scanner, please take a moment to confirm
        that the reported issues are actually valid and exploitable. In this specific
        case, we believe that the default state of the `X-XSS-Protection` header is
        sufficient for our purposes. Please reply if you have a working proof-of-concept
        that could be mitigated by an adjustment to our header.\n"}},{"id":"108887","attributes":{"title":"X-Content-Type-Options:

        issues and/or false positives. Before submitting the results from a scanner,
        please take a moment to confirm that the reported issues are actually valid
        and exploitable. In this specific case, the `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
        header is only necessary on endpoints that serve untrusted user content. Please
        reply if you have a working proof-of-concept or reason to believe that this
        issue is exploitable.\n"}},{"id":"108888","attributes":{"title":"X-Frame-Options
        / Clickjacking","message":"The lack of X-Frame-Options does not always indicate
        that a security vulnerability is present. This is an optional header that
        is only necessary on endpoints where there UI is rendered to invoke state
        changing actions. We recommend reading this informative post by David Ross:
        https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DavidRossX/posts/jVrtTRd5yKP\n"}},{"id":"108889","attributes":{"title":"Autocomplete","message":"We
        intentionally leave autocomplete enabled as we believe that all modern browsers
        now handle local form completion in a reasonably sane manner. Autocomplete
        enables individuals to use stronger passwords and makes them less susceptible
        to phishing attacks. These benefits greatly outweigh the minor risk here.
        If you disagree, we encourage you to also read this post: https://blog.0xbadc0de.be/archives/124\n"}},{"id":"108890","attributes":{"title":"SSL
        - RC4 / BEAST Information","message":"Automated vulnerability scanners commonly
        have low priority issues and/or false positives. Before submitting the results
        from a scanner, please take a moment to confirm that the reported issues are
        actually valid and exploitable. In this instance, we intentionally use RC4
        when the client is connecting with TLS 1.0 and earlier as an effective mitigation
        against the \"BEAST\" attack. For clients that support TLS 1.1 and higher,
        we prioritize non-RC4 ciphers. We believe that this is consistent with current
        industry best practices. For more information, please review this post: https://blog.cloudflare.com/killing-rc4\nThis
        combination most effectively balances the competing risks associated with
        weaker RC4 ciphers and the BEAST attack scenario.\n"}},{"id":"108891","attributes":{"title":"Video
        Without Content","message":"Using a video to demonstrate a potential issue
        should only be necessary in rare situations and should always be accompanied
        with a text description of the issue as well. Please update this report with
        step-by-step instructions to reproduce the core components of the issue. If
        you don''t speak English, feel free to leave your report in your own language,
        and we''ll try our best to find someone who can help translate.\n"}}],"links":{}}'
