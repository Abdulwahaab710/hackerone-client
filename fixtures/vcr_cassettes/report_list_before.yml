        Enterprise is the on-premises version of GitHub. GitHub Enterprise shares
        a code-base with GitHub.com, is built on Ruby on Rails and leverages a number
        of open source technologies.\n\nGitHub Enterprise adds a number of features
        for enterprise infrastructures. This includes additional authentication backends
        and clustering options. Below is a subset of features unique to GitHub Enterprise
        that might be interesting to investigate.\n\n- Instance-wide authentication
        ([*private mode*](https://help.github.com/enterprise/admin/guides/installation/enabling-private-mode/))\n-
        External authentication backends including [CAS, LDAP, and SAML](https://help.github.com/enterprise/admin/guides/user-management/)\n-
        In-app administration of the instance using a site administrator control panel\n-
        [User, organization, and repository migration](https://help.github.com/enterprise/admin/guides/migrations/)\n-
        [Web-based management console](https://help.github.com/enterprise/admin/guides/installation/web-based-management-console/)
        and [SSH access](https://help.github.com/enterprise/admin/guides/installation/administrative-shell-ssh-access/)
        to configure and update the instance\n- [Pre-receive hook scripts](https://help.github.com/enterprise/admin/guides/developer-workflow/creating-a-pre-receive-hook-script/)\n\nYou
        can request a trial of GitHub Enterprise for security testing at [https://enterprise.github.com/bounty](https://enterprise.github.com/bounty).\n\n-
        Resources and features provided by the latest patch release of each non-deprecated
        version of the GitHub Enterprise virtual machine. Major versions of GitHub
        Enterprise are deprecated one year after release. For more information see
        [this list of releases](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/).\n- All listening
        services hosted on a GitHub Enterprise instance. See [our documentation](https://help.github.com/enterprise/admin/guides/installation/network-ports-to-open/)
        for a reference of ports typically opened on a GitHub Enterprise instance.\n-
        Code de-obfuscation may be explored to further investigate GitHub Enterprise,
        but only for the purpose of the bounty program. Bounty hunters still need
        to abide by all of our other Bounty program rules and terms and the applicable
        software license terms.\n\nIneligible submissions:\n- Vulnerabilities caused
        by lack of subdomain isolation\n- Escalation to the root user via sudo\n-
